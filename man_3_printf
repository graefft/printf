.TH _PRINTF 3 "15 March 2019" "VERSION 1.0" "_printf man page"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include """holberton.h"""
.sp
.BI "_printf(const char * " format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR _printf ()
produces output according to a
.I format
as described below. The function writes output to
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
This function writes output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via
the variable-length argument facilities of
.BR stdarg (3))
are converted for output.

.SS Return value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial shift state, if any.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream;
and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or
more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
.IR flags ,
an optional minimum
.IR "field width" ,
an optional
.I precision
and an optional
.IR "length modifier" .

.SS The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is
padded on the left with zeros.
The default precision is 1.
When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.TP
.BR o ", " u ", " x ", " X
The
.I "unsigned int"
argument is converted to unsigned octal
.RB ( o ),
unsigned decimal
.RB ( u ),
or unsigned hexadecimal
.RB ( x
and
.BR X )
notation.
The letters
.B abcdef
are used for
.B x
conversions; the letters
.B ABCDEF
are used for
.B X
conversions.
.TP
.B c
If no
.B l
modifier is present, the
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
If an
.B l
modifier is present, the
.I wint_t
(wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call
to the
.BR wcrtomb (3)
function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, and the
resulting multibyte string is written.
.TP
.B r
Prints the string in reverse.
.TP
.B R
Prints the string in rot13 encryption.
.TP
.B s
If no
.B l
modifier is present: The
.I "const char\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq);
If an
.B l
modifier is present: The
.I "const wchar_t\ *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide characters.
Wide characters from the array are converted to multibyte characters
(each by a call to the
.BR wcrtomb (3)
function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state before
the first wide character), up to and including a terminating null
wide character.
The resulting multibyte characters are written up to
(but not including) the terminating null byte.
If a precision is
specified, no more bytes than the number specified are written, but
no partial multibyte characters are written.
Note that the precision
determines the number of
.I bytes
written, not the number of
.I wide characters
or
.IR "screen positions" .
The array must contain a terminating null wide character, unless a
precision is given and it is so small that the number of bytes written
exceeds it before the end of the array is reached.
if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified
are written.
If a precision is given, no null byte need be present;
if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the
array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B p
The
.I "void\ *"
pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by
.B %#x
or
.BR  %#lx ).
